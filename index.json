    "body": "I am a graduate student at Iowa State University pursuing a PhD co-majoring in Mechanical engineering and Applied Mathematics. I am co-advised by Dr. Baskar Ganapathysubramanian and Dr. James Rossmanith. I work on development and analysis of numerical schemes for high fidelity simulations of fluid flows. As a part of my PhD I am currently developing energy stable numerical methods to simulate two-phase flows using Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations. I also have experience in development of tools to analyse and understand complex physical processes like multi-phase flows and turbulence.\nBefore joining Iowa State for my graduate work I had a brief stint as a research associate in Dr. Krishnaswamy Nandakumar\u0026rsquo;s group in Louisiana State University. There I worked on energy transfer processes in multi-phase flows.\n Education: Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa   PhD with a co-major in Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mathematics [2016 – Aug 2021 (expected)]\nDissertation: Energy stable numerical methods for interface resolved simulations of two-phase flows using Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations.\nGraduate advisors: Prof. Baskar Ganapathysubramanian and Prof. James Rossmanith\n  Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai, India  Bachelors of Technology in Chemical Technology [2011 – 2015]   Research Interests:  Multiphase flows Finite Element Methods Numerical Analysis Turbulence Multi-scale analysis of stochastic processes  ",
