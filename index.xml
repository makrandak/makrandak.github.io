      <description>In picture above: Comparison of bubble shapes and terminal velocities with experimental results and corresponding streamlines.
Summary In our recent work on block-solver for simulating two-phase flows with deforming interfaces at various density contrasts by solving thermodynamically consistent Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations. We use fully implicit non-linear finite element based methods.
 Highlights of the work   Two-phase flows simulated using thermodynamically consistent Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations.
  Provably energy-stable Crank-Nicolson-type time integration scheme.</description>

      <description>In picture above: Progression of 2D Rayleigh-Taylor instability to chaotic turbulent regime for the density ratio of 1:10.
Summary In our recent work on fully coupled solver for simulating two-phase flows by solving thermodynamically consistent Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations (CHNS). We use fully implicit non-linear finite element based methods. The fully coupled approach solves CHNS equations in one full block minimizing the number of matrix assemblies compared to the block approach.</description>

      <description>I currently am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Center for Turbulence Research, Stanford University, where I work with Prof. Ali Mani. I recieved my PhD at Iowa State University co-majoring in Mechanical engineering and Applied Mathematics. I was co-advised by Dr. Baskar Ganapathysubramanian and Dr. James Rossmanith. I work on development and analysis of numerical schemes for high fidelity simulations of fluid flows. As a part of my PhD, I developed energy stable numerical methods to simulate two-phase flows using Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations.</description>
